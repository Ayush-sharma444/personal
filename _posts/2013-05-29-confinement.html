<h2><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: large;">D. Balagué, J. A. Carrillo, Y. Yao</span></span></h2><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">We investigate the confinement properties of solutions of the aggregation equation with repulsive-attractive potentials. We show that solutions remain compactly supported in a large fixed ball depending on the initial data and the potential. The arguments apply to the functional setting of probability measures with mildly singular repulsive-attractive potentials and to the functional setting of smooth solutions with a potential being the sum of the Newtonian repulsion at the origin and a smooth suitably growing at infinity attractive potential.</div><br />Discrete and Continuous Dynamical Systems-B 19, 1227–1248, 2014.<br /><br /><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.0602">arXiv</a> Mon, 1 Oct 2012
