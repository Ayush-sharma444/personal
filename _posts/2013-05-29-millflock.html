<h2><span style="font-size: large; font-weight: normal;">G. Albi, D. Balagué, J. A. Carrillo, J. von Brecht</span></h2><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">We study the linear stability of flock and mill ring solutions of two individual based models for biological swarming. The individuals interact via a nonlocal interaction potential that is repulsive in the short range and attractive in the long range. We relate the instability of the flock rings with the instability of the ring solution of the first order model. We observe that repulsive-attractive interactions lead to new configurations for the flock rings such as clustering and fattening formation. Finally, we numerically explore mill patterns arising from this kind of interactions together with the asymptotic speed of the system.</div><br /><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1304.5459v1">arXiv</a> Fri, 19 Apr 2013<br /><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1137/13091779X">SIAM J.
