Hello everyone!  I am starting a new position at Case Western Reserve University, in Cleveland OH. I will not have an official email until next Monday. I will keep you posted with new updates.  From 07/12/16 to 07/15/16 you can find me in the SIAM conference on Life Sciences in Boston. Do not miss my talk!
