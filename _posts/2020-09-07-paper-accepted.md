My most recent paper submitted __Analysis of spherical shell solutions for the radially symmetric aggregation equation__ in collaboration with A. Barbaro, J. A. Carrillo, and R. Volkin, has been accepted for publication in _Siam Journal on Applied Dynamical Systems_. 

I will post the details once it is published!
